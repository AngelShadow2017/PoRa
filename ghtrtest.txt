[LAVELA0]
We decided to start from the waterfall near our
home. Here, we met the first wave of zombies.
After investigating, we learned the direction of the
zombies’ lair through the direction where the
zombies attack. Following them can greatly
reduce our workload. However, the urgent task
now is to deal with this group of zombies that
have found us.

[LBVELA0]

[LAVELA1]
Following this road, we reached the lower waterfall, 
where we met zombies again. In order to adapt to 
the battle on the water, Lily Pad came to help
us, and with an important piece of information:
A new type of zombie has arrived.

The howling wind filled you with determination.
Finally, we came to the top of Maple Lake,
However, the wind suddenly blew, and the falling 
leaves instantly filled the air. Now, we need to
traverse through this lake where the wind is
blowing violently.

[LAVELA5]
After leaving Maple Waterfall, we arrived at
another water body connected to it, the
Mysterious Swamp. The thick plant growth has
completely blocked the sunlight, and Sunflower
is ready for a big battle. Due to mud appearing out
of thin air, this battle has become harder than ever. 
Fortunately, while the extra zombie forces have not
yet arrived, Lily Pad has brought a helper - Lorus,
to support us.

[LBVELA5]
A swampy and dirty challenge.

[LCVELA5]
Being fixated on the seed packets that look like
shooting stars, zombies will now appear and
disappear in the mud while Lorus is fighting
against them. 
Zombies walk along the muddy puddles. 
You will receive 15 sun each wave.

We arrived at an island in the middle of the
Mysterious Swamp. The night has come, but it
makes no difference from the day. It took us two
days to climb the waterfall, and fight with
Hurriclover during the autumn equinox. However,
the environment of the Mysterious Swamp has
already cost us almost one day, and all the plants
expect to cross the swamp in four days. The other
side already has new reinforcements, but
fortunately, we have some as well - Opti-caltrop
and Corchid.

[LBVELA6]
Fireflies are roaming across the battlefield.
Make good use of your Opti-caltrops!

[LCVELA6]
Zombies can’t be seen as if they have used some

We have finally reached the center of Mysterious
Swamp. Here we encounter the local Lightning
Reed, who was invited by Hurriclover to assist us in
the battle. It is said that a meteorite once fell here,
and this meteorite was used by zombies to create a
strange arrow.
Legend has it that this arrow can activate certain
abilities…

[LBVELA7]
Those who listen to the subtlety of bows and arrows
sincerely believe that they can turn danger into
peace while saving the dead.
Adjust to the unpredictability of the basic Zombies!

         Anyway, remember to give feedback when you hear this. (please)

[MUSIC4]
Player's Score

[MUSIC4_TXT]
No.4 Player's Score
   Theme song of death interface 
         Touhou Project’s death music,
         I feel that the death interface is very quiet,
         Plus, I'm a Touhou player, so I added it.
         The feeling of desolation after death.

[MUSIC5]
A Big Map Full of History

[MUSIC5_TXT]
No.5 A Big Map Full of History
   Theme song of main menu
          A feeling of epicness, seeing such a map, 
          Feels like the world has expanded instantly. 
          As the main menu music, the atmosphere is quite good. 
          Of course, this map is not only for GhTr.

[MUSIC6]
Choose Your Seed

[MUSIC6_TXT]
No.6 Choose Your Seed
   Theme song of seed selection interface Plants vs. Zombies 2.
          Song taken from Neon Mixtape Tour. 
          GHtr also used this seed-selecting music ~ 
          So GhTr uses it again. Maybe it will be changed later, maybe it won't?

[MUSIC7]
The Entrance to Another World

[MUSIC7_TXT]
No.7 The Entrance to Another World
   Theme song of title interface 
         This time, the main menu adopts the melody of Touhou Project, 
         Of course, there is also the melody of Plants vs. Zombies. 
         It's probably a song of dreams and traditions, 
         By the way, this is the first self-made song of GhTr.

[MUSIC8]
Autumn Waterfall

[MUSIC8_TXT]
No.8 Autumn Waterfall
   Theme song of Maple Falls.
          Song written by Promise.
          The pleasant music will make you feel good!
          Quite cheerful! Think of a trip to the Waterfall. 
          Then again, the first boss level should not be very hard, right...?

[MUSIC9]
Lake Dweller's Requiem ~ Blover's Requiem

[MUSIC9_TXT]
No.9 Lake Dweller's Requiem ~ Blover's Requiem
   Theme song of Hurriclover 
         Hurriclover is a character who plays a very important role in Ghtr, 
         Of course, he is also important in GhTr ... in a sense. 
         It's a requiem, but it's not sad, 
         With powerful volume it can also subdue the soul! (Not really)

[MUSIC10]
Hidden Spirit ~ What's the TRUTH?

[MUSIC10_TXT]
No.10 Hidden Spirit ~ What's the TRUTH?
     Theme song of hidden level 
            The first song of the GHTR series with English written both before and after "~", 
            A mysterious feeling, and seems to be closer to something mysterious. 
            Actually, this song was originally written for another mysterious thing, 
            The composition of the original owner is also reflected in the title of the song.

[MUSIC11]
Mysterious Swamp

[MUSIC11_TXT]
No.11 Mysterious Swamp
   Theme song of the Mysterious Swamp
          A totally different style from the Waterfall, 
          The song renders a mysterious and eerie atmosphere. 
          The wet swamp… seems to be full of danger…

[MUSIC12]
Lost God ~ Lost in Force

[MUSIC12_TXT]
No.12 Lost God ~ Lost in Force
   Majorist's theme song.
     He is a god once worshiped by a zombie known as the Ancestral Zombie. 
     The song mainly reflects the mystery and sacredness of being a god.
     That said, comparing world settings is always something many love to do.
     That's where the design idea of this boss comes from.

[MUSIC13]
LOST IN FORCE

[MUSIC13_TXT]
No.13 LOST IN FORCE
   Majorist's theme after activating the Artifact.
     The power of the gods comes from the worship of thousands of creatures.
     Letting more people worship them is what the gods generally do,
     However, the Majorist, being awakened by the Artifact, skips this process and directly enjoys its powers.
     But what are the benefits of skipping the process and jumping directly into the results?

                               Dr. Zomboss went out with Zomam to deal with this matter. At 
                                the same time, Ghastasaucey, who lives in Gast Mountain, was 
                               very interested in this matter, so ShiChu also took action. On the plants’

Author's word

[MANUAL2_TXT]
————————————————————————————
Welcome to the third chapter of GHTR! PVZ GhTr ~ Perfect Voyage! 
Although this version isn’t complete, please be patient, as it will be complete in the near future. 
There may be some bugs in this version. If you find them, you can give us some feedbacks
and we will fix them. 
The style of GhTr is different from Ghtr and GHtr. The style this mod uses is brand-new (x2, really brand-new).
Moreover, in addition to PVZ's gameplay, ftg and stg are also included in this game. 
Although it is a bonus, these two ways of playing are also the main ways of playing this 
mod. (Not in this version though)
————————————————————————————
When this version was planned, it was about the beginning of 2021, and it was planned 
very early, which means It's relatively perfect. So compared with Ghtr and GHtr, 
tinkering is less likely to happen. And it can basically be done in one sitting (however, bugs 
are still unavoidable, sad).
————————————————————————————
I can't think of anything else to say, QWQ

[MANUAL4]
Locations

[MANUAL4_TXT]
————————————————————————————
I. Maple Waterfall
           Appearance: The first level
　　It is located on the east side of the house, you can reach the
　　Waterfall after crossing the street. It's bigger than house several
　　times, and its height is about two kilometers (the highest in the
　　world is 979m). It's also very wide, but all the places you
　　encounter in the game are narrow. There is a large lake (Maple
　　Lake) at the top of the waterfall, which is where the water comes
　　from.
　　The waterfall is windy almost every time (usually high winds,
　　sometimes hurricanes and typhoons), so remember to take
　　precautions when you arrive here. 
　　However, if we don't consider the wind, it is not a dangerous
　　place. 
　　Although the waterfall is high, steps have already been built
　　around the mountain, so it is a very safe place (of course, falling
　　into the water is still very dangerous).
　　Hurriclover usually lives on a small island in the center of Maple
　　Lake (only when there is something wrong will he find his way to
　　the house). Because of Hurriclover, Potato Mines often appeared
　　around this place.
————————————————————————————
II.Maple Waterfall Cave
         Appearance: The first hidden level
　　Located inside Maple Lake, it used to be a paradise for monkeys
　　thousands of years ago.
　　However, it was gradually abandoned due to industrialization.
　　Inside the cave dimly lit a set of furniture made in heaven.
　　If you go deeper, you will see a river that is said to be connected
　　to the "East Sea", but no one knows whether it really is the East
　　Sea or not. In fact, some found out after their investigations that
　　it actually leads to a sea area located on the west side of Maple
　　Mountain.
　　Of course, he is already forgotten, not many people know the
       location of his cave entry. Most people only know that there used
       to be one in the lower course of the river. Although, it’s rumored,
       that there are secrets hidden within.
————————————————————————————
III.Mysterious Swamp 
           Appearance: The second level.
       A swamp area connected with Maple Lake. 
       There has always been a mysterious atmosphere in this swamp area.
       Even without any detailed records to prove it, the legend of horrible
       witches have been circulating here; 
       Even though no one ever fell victim to this area (at least not recorded),
       there is still a mysterious and gloomy feeling when one enters the place.
　　In fact, not much is known about this place. It is only known that a
       certain someone used to be here a long time ago (some traces are left
       behind, such as mechanisms that need to be studied to activate)
　　But no one knows when it was abandoned.
       Thus formed the current Mysterious Swamp.

  This paragragh was written by myself(Ghastasaucey),my English
is not good,there may be many etiquette or grammar problems,please
forgive me.

[GHASTASAUCEY_WARNINGSTART]
Hello, %s.

[GHASTASAUCEY_WARNINGNEXT]
Well, nothing much. Just, I have a small request.

[GHASTASAUCEY_WARNINGMAIN]
May I make a little mark on your save?
Just a mark, no more no less.

[GHASTASAUCEY_WARNINGSELECT]
<Z>Go ahead           <X>No

[GHASTASAUCEY_WARNINGGREAT]
Alright, thanks. I won’t bother you again for now.

[GHASTASAUCEY_WARNINGBAD]
Don’t blame me today!

[MAJORIST_1]
Good. Very good. Excellent.
Simply fantastic!
I’ve never felt this good in
my life.

[MAJORIST_2]
The power of the Artifact is
extraordinarily refreshing!

[MAJORIST_3]
And so
##CFF0000FFS##CGuffered ##CFF0000FFP##CGromiseitem ##CFF0000FFMajorist##CG
(TL Note: Majorist suffering
from the Artifact) was born!

[MAJORIST_4]
Homing Thistle, Red Stinger,
To congratulate me on the birth
of this power of perfection,
and to honor the prizes of the
quiz show,

[MAJORIST_5]
I’ll be hosting a wonderful
event!

[MAJORIST_6]
And the first step in the event
is…

[MAJORIST_7]
Putting your power to the test!

[MAJORIST_8]
Event starts! Wastes removed!
Are you ready?!

[MAJORIST_9]
You see, isn’t this power only
found in heaven?

[MAJORIST_10]
Even the belief originated from
the Ancestral Zombie couldn’t
get anywhere close.

[MAJORIST_11]
Unlimited power, ultra-short
recharge, placeable zombies.
And most importantly,
"summoning muds".

[MAJORIST_12]
Homing Thistle, Red Stinger,
this is true power, yes?

[MAJORIST_13]
Have you ever thought
about it?
Doing whatever you want,
ignoring all recharge and
sun cost?

[MAJORIST_14]
I now fully appreciate the
beauty of this power!

[MAJORIST_15]
Why putting up with those
"7.5s, 30s, 50s" recharge, and
those "100, 50" sun cost? Why
are you still rigidly adhering to
the "rules" made for the weak?

[MAJORIST_16]
Look at me, look at me!
Enjoy this all-in-one feast!
I can even ignore the original
bullet limit, and fire more
shots than ever before!

[MAJORIST_17]
Homing Thistle, Red Stinger,

[MAJORIST_18]
Wouldn’t you like to skip the
annoying process of
"training", and
immediately achieve this
"peak of power"?

[MAJORIST_19]
I’m tired of living like I used
to, taking things from other
places. Look now, I can
easily utilize many things
just from inside this world!

[MAJORIST_20]
Hm, that’s enough for the
aptitude test.

[MAJORIST_21]
Homing Thistle, Red Stinger,

[MAJORIST_22]
HOMING THISTLE!!!
RED STINGER!!!

[MAJORIST_23]
Ask yourself,

[MAJORIST_24]
Don’t you worship such a
power?

[MAJORIST_25]
Is that all the power you two
have?

[MAJORIST_26]
Even your strongest spear
cannot stand up to the
hardest shield in the world!

[MAJORIST_27]
Enter defensive mode!

[MAJORIST_28]
Look at how weak your
damage output is against
this shield.

[MAJORIST_29]
Can’t it be more powerful?

[MAJORIST_30]
Why… My HP is dropping?

[MAJORIST_31]
Where are my powers?!

[MAJORIST_32]
No matter, I have another
plan…

Although they are literally different species, their relationship is quite good. 
I suppose Lily Pad also has told you about that on the way?

[TALK137]
00030001000000000100000000000000000000
62A521FFBefore the war broke out, Lily Pad and Lorus lived in the same pond. 
Lily Pad was in the water and Lorus was on the shore. Later, as the zombies approach, 
Lily Pad was forced to go to the front because of the need for war in ponds.
And if Lorus goes together, zombies would be able to attack through the pond, so they haven't seen each other for a long time.

[TALK138]
00030001000000000100000000000000000000

29D659FFNow let’s take a look at how each plant works!
First, we need to understand the ##C9CD437FFPeashooter##CG!
We saw him attack just now! Next let’s learn about ##T((The process of crossbreeding can be seen as follows:
Each allele of the same gene (i.e. A and a) of a Peashooter is randomly combined with that of another Peashooter.
For instance, when Aa and aa are crossbred, the former can be separated to A and a while the latter can only be separated to a and a.
These alleles will randomly combine and thus the probabilities of the offspring being Aa and aa are equal.
In general, different genes do not interfere with each other (i.e. A and a do not interfere with B and b)
This mod has two genes being on the same homologous chromosome.
It does not have an impact on the gameplay however, so you can try finding them yourself.||crossbreeding))!
##CFFFF00FFRight-click a pea, then right-click another pea to crossbreed##CG. Try it now!

[TALK846]
000E0000000000000100000000020F00000000

Each gene determines a phenotype. (there can be multiple genes that determine one phenotype)

As for the specifics, I don’t know!
You can also consume ##CFFFF00FF100 sun to make a Peashooter ##T((You can think of it as two Peashooters with the same genotype crossbreeding with each other.
This will bring Peashooters closer to being homozygotes.
Homozygosity is basically each pair of letters in the genotype having the same case (i.e. AAbb).||self-pollinate))##CG, or ##CFFFF00FFplant another Peashooter directly on top of him##CG.
You can try these yourself later.
Different genes will have ##T((There can be two genes controlling the same effect||different effects)). For example, let’s take a look at this Peashooter, who can shoot fire peas in 3 lanes!

[TALK847]
000E0000000000000100000000021000000000
29D659FFNext is the ##CFDF276FFSunflower##CG!
Sunflowers produce sun on a regular basis, providing you ##CFFFF00FFmore sun to grow your plants##CG!
It’s very simple, so we won’t try it out.

[TALK848]
000E0000000000000100000000021100000000
29D659FFSunflowers can also be matched! The Sunflowers will then disappear and give you something in return!
##CFFFF00FFLine up 3, 4 or 5 Sunflowers to match them##CG!
I’ve already planted some Sunflowers. Planting Sunflowers on the empty tiles between them can trigger the match,
##T((In fact, if a match-3 or match-4 is triggered at the same time as a match-5, the strengthened Sunflower will not disappear.
For instance, in a T-shaped match, if there is a vertical match-4, the Sunflower in the center of the match-3 will remain.
Of course, if the strengthened Sunflower is created by two match-4s at the same time, the effect will stack.
Specifically, a match-4 will make the second Sunflower closest to the upper left have 3/4 the original sun production time. 
A match-5 will make the center Sunflower produce twice as much sun and cannot be strengthened.||3 Sunflowers will give you sun, 4 and 5 Sunflowers will strengthen the middle Sunflower)).
It goes a little something like this-
