[SPRING EXTRA DIALOGUES ARE NOT FINISHED]
---Spring Extra - Day 1---
Dave: Alright, neighbor, quick review on what we're gonna do.
Dave: I'm running out of tacos at home, and the taco vendors all got sabotaged for whatever reason.
Dave: So now we're traveling in search of the legendary TACOLAND!
Dave: And maybe some stuff for my GOAT collection.
Dave: Ooh, looks like there are pools of water on the lawn. I'll give ya some Lily Pads.
Dave: Plant a couple of 'em on the water and ain't any plants gonna drown today!
---Spring Extra - Day 2---
Dave: You might've noticed that flying plants can stay on top of the water too.
Dave: But these nasty Imps really love to bring trouble. They completely ignore flying plants!
Dave: More zombies are coming here. Be sure to protect those Lily Pads, neighbor!
Dave: Why protect them? Because THEY'RE AS CRAAAAAZZYYYY as me for staying there!!!
---Spring Extra - Day 3---
Dave: Come to think of it, where the heck are we?
Dave: Didn't we just walk a few miles away from home? This doesn't look like Neighborville at all!
Dave: Dang it, I should've brought a map.

(After completing Spring Extra - Day 3)
(Following dialogues are written in text box) (Note: This is how the characters talk in-game)
??????: Ya guys know why we're gathered here right?
??????: Man I love it when bug reports get flooded with the same thing.
????: what do you mean theres bug? the game isnt updated in ages
?????: According to these witnesses, it seems that some force has caused this game we govern to screw itself up.
?????: And as a result, the in-game locations are no longer where they should be.
????: what
???: Oh, not only that, I think the seasons are all in disorder as well.
????: i thought that was intentional, arent you supposed to be fixing it
???: Well you see, there's a teeny tiny bit of a problem.
---Spring Extra - Day 4---
(After completing Spring Extra - Day 4)
??????: You lost track of the machine?!!!
????: he WHAT
???: I left it somewhere around a bridge, but then the locations become all scrambled up.
?????: You do realize that the machine is currently our only method of interacting with the game code, right?
?????: The Holy Apple will not like this- Hold on, where did The Holy Apple go?
??????: That's it, folks. Game's on hiatus forever. We're also stuck in this game forever. Yay.
????: wait isnt he supposed to be responsible
???: Me? Are you serious?
??????: You just left the machine in some weird place and keep building your so-called forest world.
????: dude this isnt minekraf
??????: Remember, we're here to make sure that Dave stays on the right path, so the story could go like how it SHOULD be.
???: So what? It was still the game that caused this.
??????: oH iT wAs AlL tHe GaMe How 'bout you find that darn machine first and then we'll talk?
????: good idea, now scram
---Spring Extra - Day 5---
Arbiter: FiNd ThE dArN mAcHiNe bla bla bla
Arbiter: Who the hell do they think they are?
Arbiter: Wait, isn't that the Dave guy I'm supposed to 'escort'? Weird orange beard with a pot on his head?
Arbiter: ...I guess I'd better stay away from him.
Dave:


---Winter Extra - Night 1---
Dave: Whoo... Seems like we managed to escape that A-bitter guy.
Dave: Now where the heck are we? My lips are starting to feel like frozen chips!
Dave: And the cold sure doesn't stop the zombies either! In fact, I think there's even more of 'em!
Dave: It's also nighttime so we won't get any more sun from the sky. Now that's just dandy. ("that's just dandy" is often said as a joke when really something is not good)
Dave: But luckily I've stockpiled a bunch of new plants- Wait, where did the lamp gadget go?
Dave: Must've dropped it. Oh, but we've got Solartropa! Sun won't be a problem with this plant around!
Dave: Find a way to prevent yourself from freezing, neighbor! I'll go get something warm.
---Winter Extra - Night 2---
Dave: Brrrr... This is starting to feel colder than being in a freezer!
Dave: And look at all those ice blocks and ice holes!
Dave: Good thing Befrozenia is here to help us.
Dave: Maybe you should try putting more plants to the right side to bait the wind.
Dave: Use plants like Spore-shroom for that and you'll be A-O-FANTASTIC.
Dave: And if things ever go wrong, just blow everything up!!!
Dave: Hope that hot tip's gonna keep you warm for the night!
---Winter Extra - Night 3---
Arbiter: Aha! I've finally found you, Dave.
Dave: Oh no! The A-bitter guy!
Arbiter: You had the guts to disturb my forest yet you fail to remember my name. Dispicable.
Dave: But I didn't do anything wrong!
Dave: I was just trying to find foo- I mean fend off the zombies in the forest!
Arbiter: You dare fool me, mortal? There were not this many zombies until YOU showed up.
Dave: Here's the conveyor belt, neighbor! Use those explosives wisely while I RUN AWAY FROM THIS GUY!
---Winter Extra - Night 4---
Arbiter: So it has come to this.
Arbiter: I shall once again call forth the dark side of your memory.
Dave: Wha-? The zombies disappeared?!
Arbiter: Haha, they are merely invisible. This must've been the work of your mortal enemy.
Dave: Mr. Boss Guy and his buffooneries!
Dave: Well, neighbor, we beat him once, we'll beat him again!
---Winter Extra - Night 5---
(Zomboss appears like in pvz2)
Zomboss: David, I seem to have discovered that your tastes are getting disappointingly, and infuriatingly... bad.
Zomboss: Be honest, David. What is your opinion on my new big bot bird?
Zomboss: Withstand its freezing strikes, and witness the true beauty of my creation! Mwhahahaha!
Dave: Wait, that's a bird? I thought that was some... igloo monstrosity.
Dave: But we've got no time for imagination. CHARGE!!!

[After the player completes Winter Extra Night 5 but have not completed the previous levels of Seasonal Extras]
Dave: Haha! We beat him again, neighbor!
Dave: But is it just me or something's amiss?...
Dave: Eh, guess I'll just go look for tacos. There's gotta be some around here somewhere.

---Seasonal Extras Ending 1--- [Already in the game, player receives it every time they finish "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge"]

---Seasonal Extras Ending 2--- [After Winter Extra Night 5, the player receives this ending if they have completed every level of Seasonal Extras and have not once finished "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge"]
(Scene turns white, plays "Floating World" from The Stanley Parable)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: Yes, as a divine being, I am aware of this world being a 'video game'.
Arbiter: Let's just say I might have misjudged you as a companion of Dave.
Arbiter: That Dave... To me, he is nothing but an irresponsible pot-wearing moron.
Arbiter: I am not sure how you even managed to befriend him... But you,
Arbiter: You are special.
Arbiter: I have seen your efforts to defeat the zombies and restore balance to this world.
Arbiter: Although the cause of all the seasonal chaos still lies somewhere in this icefield,
Arbiter: So you failed to restore the seasons to their original forms.
Arbiter: But you made an effort, and it is all that counts.
Arbiter: Therefore, I will present to you a gift in return.
Arbiter: Something that will benefit you in this 'video game'.
Arbiter: Aha, the Eleventh Seed Slot, without a single cent. How does that sound?
(Clicking the dialogue box here does not do anything. A bunch of seed packets show up like this image (except the bottom only has 2 seed packets): https://prnt.sc/iJyx8cUMMu_Y Two buttons, <Yes> and <No>, appear below the dialogue box. The player must click one of the buttons to continue)

(If the player click <Yes>)
Arbiter: Hm, good choice.
Arbiter: Oh, I almost forgot. You see, I am not in control of this whole... 'game'.
Arbiter: The Holy Apple is the one with such role. Although he will not be happy with this idea.
Arbiter: He keeps complaining about the 'game UI'... You might have to get permission from him first.

(If the player click <No>)
Arbiter: Oh. Such a shame.
Arbiter: I thought you would love to fill the corners of your screen with seed packets,
Arbiter: Like that one fangame where food fights against mice. (Note: referencing 原美食大战老鼠)
Arbiter: Though that would mess with the 'game UI', and The Holy Apple does not particularly like that...

(Both choices lead to this)
Arbiter: Well, it was nice to have you here today.
Arbiter: I wish you all the best in restoring the seasons once and for all.
Arbiter: Then, if you can return here, I will give you the best gift you could ever ask for.

---Seasonal Extras Ending 3--- [After Winter Extra Night 5, the player receives this ending if they have completed every level of Seasonal Extras and have finished "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge" at least once]
(Scene turns white, plays "Floating World" from The Stanley Parable)
(If the player has not ever obtained Ending 2)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: Yes, as a divine being, I am aware of this world being a 'video game'.
Arbiter: Let's just say I might have misjudged you as a companion of Dave.
Arbiter: That Dave... To me, he is nothing but an irresponsible pot-wearing moron.
Arbiter: I am not sure how you even managed to befriend him... But you,
Arbiter: You are the chosen one.
Arbiter: Not only did you manage to bring the seasons back to what they once were,
Arbiter: But you also came back to me in the end.

(If the player has obtained Ending 2 at least once)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: So you finally managed to restore the seasons, and came back to me.
Arbiter: You truly are the chosen one after all.

(Both Ifs lead to this)
Arbiter: Oh, you must be delighted to see me again. Let me prepare a gift for you in return...
Arbiter: A total of 18 seed slots! And a special VIP pass! Hm? Sounds enticing?
(A bunch of seed packets show up like this image here: https://prnt.sc/iJyx8cUMMu_Y. Clicking the dialogue box here does not do anything. Two buttons, <Yes> and <No>, appear below the dialogue box. The player must click one of the buttons to continue)

(If the player click <Yes>)
Arbiter: Hm, good choice.
Arbiter: Oh, I almost forgot. You see, I am not in control of this whole... 'game'.
Arbiter: The Holy Apple is the one with such role. Although he will not be happy with this idea.
Arbiter: He keeps complaining about the 'game UI' as you can see...

(If the player click <No>)
Arbiter: Oh. Such a shame.
Arbiter: I thought you would love to fill the corners of your screen with seed packets,
Arbiter: Like that one fangame where food fights against mice.
Arbiter: Though that would mess with the 'game UI', and The Holy Apple does not particularly like that...

(Both choices lead to this)
Arbiter: Ahem, but say,
(Note: From now on the dialogues are full of English memes so translate however you like lol)
Arbiter: It must have been painful, being nowhere but in front of that 'device' and restricted within the boundaries of a 'gamer'.
Arbiter: Come, mortal, abandon that pot-wearing moron and follow me into my forest wonderland.
Arbiter: No more social media, no more kaizo levels, no more skill issue.
Arbiter: You will finally be able to enjoy the taste of 'true freedom'.
Arbiter: Though you do not have a physical form, but worry not,
(Shows this picture on screen: https://preview.redd.it/2y82bmtv3ec51.jpg?auto=webp&s=5c2562c172f90c5d7f50bba304fdf6eab445c589)
Arbiter: I will personally place your soul into this artistically beautiful Peashooter costume.
(Picture disappears)
Arbiter: With it, we can sing, dance, eat grass and become one with Mother Nature.
Arbiter: Ah, isn't that wonderful? Isn't it what we have always wanted to do together?
(Music stops. Dave's pan comes from the right side and hits the Arbiter, which plays the metal hit sound effect and causes a screen shake. The pan then falls off from Arbiter's face.)
Dave: Hah! While you A-bitter were out chit-chatting,
Dave: I STUDIED THE PAN!
(Play "But the Earth Refused to Die" from Undertale)
(All of Arbiter's lines now become shaking text)
Arbiter: ...
Arbiter: So this... is how it ends...
Arbiter: But if you thought... this is over... you are wrong...
Arbiter: As I... have already called forth... the ancient mighty Kraken...
Arbiter: You will soon... witness its wrath... and destruction...
Dave: The Kraken? But there's barely even any water on the beach!
Arbiter: Hah... Kraken... deez nuts...
Arbiter: ...Gottem...
(Arbiter slowly fades)
Dave: (Music immediately stops) Ew.
