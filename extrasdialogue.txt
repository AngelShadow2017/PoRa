(Note: The image of the 守卫者 is named Arbiter.png so I just call him Arbiter in English)
---Winter Extra - Night 1---
Dave: Whoo... Seems like we managed to escape from that A-bitter guy.
Dave: Now where the heck are we? My lips are starting to feel like frozen chips!
Dave: And the cold sure doesn't stop the zombies either!
Dave: Find a way to prevent yourself from freezing, neighbor! I'll go get something warm.
---Winter Extra - Night 2---
Dave: Brrrr... This is starting to feel colder than being in a freezer!
Dave: And look at all those ice blocks and ice holes!
Dave: Good thing Befrozenia and Solartropa are here to help us.
Dave: And maybe you should try to put more plants on the right to bait the wind.
Dave: Hope that hot tip's gonna keep you warm for the night!
---Winter Extra - Night 3---
Arbiter: Aha! I've finally found you, Dave.
Dave: Oh no! The A-bitter guy!
Arbiter: You had the guts to disturb my forest yet you fail to remember my name. Dispicable.
Dave: But I didn't do anything wrong!
Dave: I was just trying to find foo- I mean fend off the zombies in the forest!
Arbiter: Don't you dare fool me. There were not this many zombies until YOU showed up.
Dave: Here's the conveyor belt, neighbor! Now I gotta RUN AWAY FROM THIS GUY!
---Winter Extra - Night 4---
Arbiter: So it has come to this.
Arbiter: I shall once again call forth the dark side of your memory.
Dave: Wha-? The zombies disappeared?!
Arbiter: Haha, they're merely invisible. This must be the work of your mortal enemy.
Dave: Mr. Boss Guy!
Dave: Well, neighbor, we beat him once, we'll beat him again!
---Winter Extra - Night 5---
Zomboss: Hello again, fools. What do you think of my new big bird?...
Zomboss: ...When it freezes you to death? Mwhahahaha!
