(Note: The image of the 守卫者 is named Arbiter.png so I just call him Arbiter in English)
---Winter Extra - Night 1---
Dave: Whoo... Seems like we managed to escape from that A-bitter guy.
Dave: Now where the heck are we? My lips are starting to feel like frozen chips!
Dave: And the cold sure doesn't stop the zombies either!
Dave: Find a way to prevent yourself from freezing, neighbor! I'll go get something warm.
---Winter Extra - Night 2---
Dave: Brrrr... This is starting to feel colder than being in a freezer!
Dave: And look at all those ice blocks and ice holes!
Dave: Good thing Befrozenia and Solartropa are here to help us.
Dave: And maybe you should try to put more plants on the right to bait the wind.
Dave: Hope that hot tip's gonna keep you warm for the night!
---Winter Extra - Night 3---
Arbiter: Aha! I've finally found you, Dave.
Dave: Oh no! The A-bitter guy!
Arbiter: You had the guts to disturb my forest yet you fail to remember my name. Dispicable.
Dave: But I didn't do anything wrong!
Dave: I was just trying to find foo- I mean fend off the zombies in the forest!
Arbiter: Don't you dare fool me. There were not this many zombies until YOU showed up.
Dave: Here's the conveyor belt, neighbor! Now I gotta RUN AWAY FROM THIS GUY!
---Winter Extra - Night 4---
Arbiter: So it has come to this.
Arbiter: I shall once again call forth the dark side of your memory.
Dave: Wha-? The zombies disappeared?!
Arbiter: Haha, they are merely invisible. This must be the work of your mortal enemy.
Dave: Mr. Boss Guy!
Dave: Well, neighbor, we beat him once, we'll beat him again!
---Winter Extra - Night 5---
Zomboss: Hello again, fools. What do you think of my new big bird?...
Zomboss: ...When it freezes you to death? Mwhahahaha!

---Seasonal Extras Ending 1--- [Already in the game, player receives it every time they finish "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge"]

---Seasonal Extras Ending 2--- [After Winter Extra Night 5, the player receives this ending if they have completed every level of Seasonal Extras and have not once finished "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge"]
(Scene turns white, plays "Floating World" from The Stanley Parable)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: Yes, as a divine being, I am aware of this world being a 'video game'.
Arbiter: Let's just say I might have misjudged you as a companion of Dave.
Arbiter: That Dave... To me, he is nothing but an irresponsible pot-wearing moron.
Arbiter: I am not sure how you even managed to befriend him... But you,
Arbiter: You are special.
Arbiter: I have seen your efforts to defeat the zombies and restore balance to this world.
Arbiter: Although the cause of all the seasonal chaos still lies somewhere in this icefield,
Arbiter: So you failed to restore the seasons to their original forms.
Arbiter: But you made an effort, and it is all that counts.
Arbiter: Therefore, I will present you a gift in return.
Arbiter: Something that will benefit you in this 'video game'.
Arbiter: Aha, the Eleventh Seed Slot, without a single cent. How does that sound?
(Clicking the dialogue box here does not do anything. Two buttons, <Yes> and <No>, appear below the dialogue box. The player must click one of the buttons to continue)

(If the player click <Yes>)
Arbiter: Hm, good choice.
Arbiter: Oh, I almost forgot. You see, I am not in control of this whole... 'game'.
Arbiter: Leobai is the one with such role. Although he will not be happy with this idea.
Arbiter: He keeps complaining about the 'game UI'... You might have to get permission from him first.

(If the player click <No>)
Arbiter: Oh. Such a shame.
Arbiter: I thought you would love to fill the corners of your screen with seed packets,
Arbiter: Like that one fangame where food fights against mice. (Note: referencing 原美食大战老鼠)
Arbiter: Though that would mess with the 'game UI', and Leobai does not particularly like that...

(Both choices lead to this)
Arbiter: Well, it was nice to have you here today.
Arbiter: I wish you all the best in restoring the seasons once and for all.

---Seasonal Extras Ending 3--- [After Winter Extra Night 5, the player receives this ending if they have completed every level of Seasonal Extras and have finished "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge" at least once]
(Scene turns white, plays "Floating World" from The Stanley Parable)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: Yes, as a divine being, I am aware of this world being a 'video game'.
Arbiter: Let's just say I might have misjudged you as a companion of Dave.
Arbiter: That Dave... To me, he is nothing but an irresponsible pot-wearing moron.
Arbiter: I am not sure how you even managed to befriend him... But you,
Arbiter: You are the chosen one.
Arbiter: Not only did you defeat all these trouble-making zombies,
Arbiter: But you also managed to bring the seasons back to what they once were.
Arbiter: I am genuinely impressed. Therefore, I present to you...
Arbiter: A total of 18 seed slots! And a special VIP pass! Hm? Sounds enticing?
(A bunch of seed packets show up like this image here: https://prnt.sc/iJyx8cUMMu_Y. Clicking the dialogue box here does not do anything. Two buttons, <Yes> and <No>, appear below the dialogue box. The player must click one of the buttons to continue)

(If the player click <Yes>)
Arbiter: Hm, good choice.
Arbiter: Oh, I almost forgot. You see, I am not in control of this whole... 'game'.
Arbiter: Leobai is the one with such role. Although he will not be happy with this idea.
Arbiter: He keeps complaining about the 'game UI' as you can see...

(If the player click <No>)
Arbiter: Oh. Such a shame.
Arbiter: I thought you would love to fill the corners of your screen with seed packets,
Arbiter: Like that one fangame where food fights against mice.
Arbiter: Though that would mess with the 'game UI', and Leobai does not particularly like that...

(Both choices lead to this)
Arbiter: But alternatively, you could always make a 4269 account! (Note: referencing 4399)
Arbiter: Just provide all your personal information and you will be able to play the food and mice game for FREE!
Arbiter: Ahem, but say,
(Note: These 7 lines below are full of English memes so translate however you like lol)
Arbiter: It must have been painful, being nowhere but in front of that 'device' and is restricted within the boundaries of a 'gamer'.
Arbiter: Come, mortal, abandon that pot-wearing moron and follow me into my forest wonderland.
Arbiter: No more social media, no more kaizo levels, no more skill issue. You will finally have the taste of 'true freedom'.
Arbiter: Though you do not have a physical form, but worry not,
Arbiter: I will personally place your soul into this artistically beautiful Peashooter costume.
Arbiter: With it, we can sing, dance, eat grass and become one with Mother Nature.
Arbiter: Ah, isn't that wonderful? Isn't it what we have always wanted?
(Dave's pan comes from the right side and hits the Arbiter, which causes a screen shake. The pan then falls off from Arbiter's face.)
(All of Arbiter's lines now become shaking text)
Arbiter: So this... is how it ends...
Arbiter: I will not last much longer... but do not fear, mortal,
Arbiter: As when an Arbiter falls... Another shall be born... to take their place...
Arbiter: Promise me... that you will be back in my forest... to witness the rebirth...
Arbiter: Because, dear chosen one,...
Arbiter: I love you.
(Arbiter slowly fades)
Dave: Ew.
