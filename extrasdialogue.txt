(Note: The image of the 守卫者 is named Arbiter.png so I just call him Arbiter in English)
---Winter Extra - Night 1---
Dave: Whoo... Seems like we managed to escape from that A-bitter guy.
Dave: Now where the heck are we? My lips are starting to feel like frozen chips!
Dave: And the cold sure doesn't stop the zombies either!
Dave: Find a way to prevent yourself from freezing, neighbor! I'll go get something warm.
---Winter Extra - Night 2---
Dave: Brrrr... This is starting to feel colder than being in a freezer!
Dave: And look at all those ice blocks and ice holes!
Dave: Good thing Befrozenia and Solartropa are here to help us.
Dave: And maybe you should try to put more plants on the right to bait the wind.
Dave: Hope that hot tip's gonna keep you warm for the night!
---Winter Extra - Night 3---
Arbiter: Aha! I've finally found you, Dave.
Dave: Oh no! The A-bitter guy!
Arbiter: You had the guts to disturb my forest yet you fail to remember my name. Dispicable.
Dave: But I didn't do anything wrong!
Dave: I was just trying to find foo- I mean fend off the zombies in the forest!
Arbiter: Don't you dare fool me. There were not this many zombies until YOU showed up.
Dave: Here's the conveyor belt, neighbor! Now I gotta RUN AWAY FROM THIS GUY!
---Winter Extra - Night 4---
Arbiter: So it has come to this.
Arbiter: I shall once again call forth the dark side of your memory.
Dave: Wha-? The zombies disappeared?!
Arbiter: Haha, they are merely invisible. This must be the work of your mortal enemy.
Dave: Mr. Boss Guy!
Dave: Well, neighbor, we beat him once, we'll beat him again!
---Winter Extra - Night 5---
Zomboss: Hello again, fools. What do you think of my new big bird?...
Zomboss: ...When it freezes you to death? Mwhahahaha!

---Seasonal Extras Ending 1--- [Already in the game, player receives it every time they finish "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge"]

---Seasonal Extras Ending 2--- [After Winter Extra Night 5, the player receives this ending if they have completed every level of Seasonal Extras and have not once finished "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge"]
(Scene turns white, plays "Floating World" from The Stanley Parable)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: Yes, as a divine being, I am aware of this world being a 'video game'.
Arbiter: Let's just say I might have misjudged you as a companion of Dave.
Arbiter: That Dave... To me, he is nothing but an irresponsible pot-wearing moron.
Arbiter: I am not sure how you even managed to befriend him... But you,
Arbiter: You are special.
Arbiter: I have seen your efforts to defeat the zombies and restore balance to this world.
Arbiter: Although the cause of all the seasonal chaos still lies somewhere in this icefield,
Arbiter: So you failed to restore the seasons to their original forms.
Arbiter: But you made an effort, and it is all that counts.
Arbiter: Therefore, I will present to you a gift in return.
Arbiter: Something that will benefit you in this 'video game'.
Arbiter: Aha, the Eleventh Seed Slot, without a single cent. How does that sound?
(Clicking the dialogue box here does not do anything. Two buttons, <Yes> and <No>, appear below the dialogue box. The player must click one of the buttons to continue)

(If the player click <Yes>)
Arbiter: Hm, good choice.
Arbiter: Oh, I almost forgot. You see, I am not in control of this whole... 'game'.
Arbiter: The Holy Apple is the one with such role. Although he will not be happy with this idea.
Arbiter: He keeps complaining about the 'game UI'... You might have to get permission from him first.

(If the player click <No>)
Arbiter: Oh. Such a shame.
Arbiter: I thought you would love to fill the corners of your screen with seed packets,
Arbiter: Like that one fangame where food fights against mice. (Note: referencing 原美食大战老鼠)
Arbiter: Though that would mess with the 'game UI', and The Holy Apple does not particularly like that...

(Both choices lead to this)
Arbiter: Well, it was nice to have you here today.
Arbiter: I wish you all the best in restoring the seasons once and for all.

---Seasonal Extras Ending 3--- [After Winter Extra Night 5, the player receives this ending if they have completed every level of Seasonal Extras and have finished "Remnants of a Wooden Bridge" at least once]
(Scene turns white, plays "Floating World" from The Stanley Parable)
Arbiter: Hello, the mortal behind that screen. This is The Arbiter speaking.
Arbiter: Yes, as a divine being, I am aware of this world being a 'video game'.
Arbiter: Let's just say I might have misjudged you as a companion of Dave.
Arbiter: That Dave... To me, he is nothing but an irresponsible pot-wearing moron.
Arbiter: I am not sure how you even managed to befriend him... But you,
Arbiter: You are the chosen one.
Arbiter: Not only did you manage to bring the seasons back to what they once were,
Arbiter: But you also came back to me in the end.
Arbiter: Oh you must be delighted to see me again. Let me prepare a gift for you in return...
Arbiter: A total of 18 seed slots! And a special VIP pass! Hm? Sounds enticing?
(A bunch of seed packets show up like this image here: https://prnt.sc/iJyx8cUMMu_Y. Clicking the dialogue box here does not do anything. Two buttons, <Yes> and <No>, appear below the dialogue box. The player must click one of the buttons to continue)

(If the player click <Yes>)
Arbiter: Hm, good choice.
Arbiter: Oh, I almost forgot. You see, I am not in control of this whole... 'game'.
Arbiter: The Holy Apple is the one with such role. Although he will not be happy with this idea.
Arbiter: He keeps complaining about the 'game UI' as you can see...

(If the player click <No>)
Arbiter: Oh. Such a shame.
Arbiter: I thought you would love to fill the corners of your screen with seed packets,
Arbiter: Like that one fangame where food fights against mice.
Arbiter: Though that would mess with the 'game UI', and The Holy Apple does not particularly like that...

(Both choices lead to this)
Arbiter: But alternatively, you could always make a 4269 account. (Note: referencing 4399)
Arbiter: Just provide all your personal information and you will be able to play the food and mice game for FREE!
Arbiter: Ahem, but say,
(Note: These 7 lines below are full of English memes so translate however you like lol)
Arbiter: It must have been painful, being nowhere but in front of that 'device' and is restricted within the boundaries of a 'gamer'.
Arbiter: Come, mortal, abandon that pot-wearing moron and follow me into my forest wonderland.
Arbiter: No more social media, no more kaizo levels, no more skill issue.
Arbiter: You will finally be able to enjoy the taste of 'true freedom'.
Arbiter: Though you do not have a physical form, but worry not,
(Shows this picture on screen: https://preview.redd.it/2y82bmtv3ec51.jpg?auto=webp&s=5c2562c172f90c5d7f50bba304fdf6eab445c589)
Arbiter: I will personally place your soul into this artistically beautiful Peashooter costume.
(Picture disappears)
Arbiter: With it, we can sing, dance, eat grass and become one with Mother Nature.
Arbiter: Ah, isn't that wonderful? Isn't it what we have always wanted?
(Music stops. Dave's pan comes from the right side and hits the Arbiter, which plays the metal hit sound effect and causes a screen shake. The pan then falls off from Arbiter's face.)
Dave: Hah! While you A-bitter were out chit-chatting,
Dave: I STUDIED THE PAN!
(Play "Good Night" from Undertale)
(All of Arbiter's lines now become shaking text)
Arbiter: ...
Arbiter: So this... is how it ends...
Arbiter: But if you thought... this is over... you are dead wrong...
Arbiter: As I... have already called forth... the ancient mighty Kraken...
Arbiter: You will soon... witness its wrath... and destruction...
Dave: The Kraken? But there's barely even any water on the beach!
Arbiter: Hah... Crackin'... deez nuts...
Arbiter: ...Gottem...
(Arbiter slowly fades)
Dave: (Music immediately stops) Ew.
